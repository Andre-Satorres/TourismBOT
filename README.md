# TourismBOT
A Twitter BOT that displays images/locations of good places to travel

## How to run it?
- Firstly, you need to create a twitter developer account. You can do it on this site https://developer.twitter.com/en.
- Secondly, create a Twitter Application here https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps, by clicking the "Create an app" button.

- After you create it, with everything settled (you can see videos and tutorials on the internet if you have some doubts while creating your app), you will receive some keys (be SURE that you have READ/WRITE permissions in your app). It's 2 keys and 2 encripted keys. You'll need then to run this bot.

- Take the keys and replace then by the "******" sequences in the code.

- If you want to add more images, just download them (preferably with less then 3mb) and increment the random controller variavel in the code.

- Nice!! Now just run the bot with
  ``` 
  python3 tourismBot.py
